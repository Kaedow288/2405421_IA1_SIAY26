						<p>
							My journey in technology began in firstform at highschool. I first discovered how to create excel documents, create
							powerpoints and find out how to apply such applications in our lives. In third form I completed a mini SBA that was meant to
							help with our actual SBA for fourth and fifth form and I found it challenging at first but as time went by I began to 
							understand the content clearly and apply it to my SBA. </p>

							<p> As I approached fifth form I aready completed half of my Informationg Technology SBA while preparing for my upcoming 
								CSEC exams. All i had left to do was to create a brochure and create programs for a company. While learning about how to
							program and how to apply certain aspects to it, I realized that it takes practice and can be time consuming but in the end I learned
						to appreciate it and come to find it interesting. I am now in my second year of college and although the courses are not easy, I still
					find anything in technology interesting and always willing to try to find solutions to probelms or figure out how certain aspects
				of computer science can be applied to our daily lives.</p>

						<h2>My Personality Traits, Hobbies and Academic Impact</h2>

						<div class=".trait">
							<h3>1. Curiousity</h3>
							<p><strong>My curiousity drives me to explore beyond what is taught in classrooms. I often research
								material that is beneficial to me and gives me a better understanding of how to further implement what I am
								learning in a course.
							</strong></p>
							</div>

							<div class=".trait">
							<h3>2. Responsibilty</h3>
							<p><strong>To have knowledge is to become responsible. I take responsiblilty for my academic life so I 
								can later venture into the working world with what I achieved in school. Being responsible with my academics will secure 
								a solid future for me.
							</strong></p>
						</div>

						<div class=".trait">
							<h3>3. Understanding</h3>
							<p><strong>My attention to detail is crucial as it helps to identify any errors made in school work.
								 For example: Finding the problem in a math question or rectifying an error made in a code. These examples 
								help to build my awareness to identify errors and also to check answers to ensure they are correct.

						<h2>My Hero: Denzel Washington</h2>
						<div class="hero-section">
							<h3>Favourite Quote:</h3>
							<p style="font-style:italic; font-size:1.2em; text-align:center; color:#005bba;">
								"Without commitment, you will never start. Without consistency, you will never finish."
							  </p>

								<h3>Background</h3>
								<p>Denzel Washington is one of the best actors that the world has ever seen.
								Denzel Washington is one of the best actors that the world has ever seen. With his 
								filmography dating back to the early 1980s, the New York native dedicated thousands of hours 
								to perfecting his craft, growing his fanbase and becoming an international success.</p>

					<section id="ai-report" class="section">
						<h2>AI Business Report: AI-driven financial advisory</h2>
						<div class="ai-report">
							<h3>Introduction and Application to the world:</h3>
							<p>My favorite idea of the AI Business List 2025 was number 6, AI-driven financial advisory. AI is widely used around the world. 
								In this case, it is used for financial data, which is a good thing for advisors who may sometimes 
								have trouble speaking about financial issues that may be difficult to explain to customers.</p>

							<h3>Its Unsefulness:</h3>
							<p>AI-driven financial advisory is useful as it gives plausible explanations about financial data and can help
								 a great number of customers, investors and other stakeholders.</p>

								 <h3>Ethical Issues:</h3>
								 <p> AI driven financial advisory can pose serious risks such as data privacy, 
									financial risk and lack of human judgement. Data privacy is a risk that allows AI to have
									 sensitive data regarding financial information. Secondly,  financial risk AI can make mistakes 
									 therefore leading to significant financial losses. Finally, dependence on AI is not advisable as 
									 there is a lack of human judgement.</p>

									 <h3>Solutions:</h3>
									 <p>Some proposed solutions include proper implementation of privacy policies and
										 strong data protection. Secondly, provide clear disclaimers about investment risk 
										 and finally, include advisors for complex questions that AI may not understand.</p>

										 <h3>Example: Sobot.io</h3>
										 <p>This AI-powered chatbot is designed to handle the unique challenges of the financial 
											sector while delivering exceptional customer service. </p>

						<h2>Twelve Pillars-Chapters 4-7 Reflection</h2>
						<div class="chapter-summary">
							<h3>Chapter 4: Achieve your goals</h3>
							<p>This chapter taught me that the main reason for setting goals is personal growth. The process of working toward goals changes us into better people. I learned to write down my goals to make them real and break big goals into smaller steps.</p>
                <p><strong> I will create specific academic goals for each semester and track my progress weekly.</strong></p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="chapter-summary">
                <h3>Chapter 5: The Proper Use of Time</h3>
                <p>This chapter emphasized that we must choose between the pain of discipline or the pain of regret. Time is precious, and we should spend it on activities that align with our goals rather than just urgent tasks.</p>
                <p><strong> I will use a planner to schedule study time and limit distractions during important tasks.</strong></p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="chapter-summary">
                <h3>Chapter 6: Surround Yourself With the Best People</h3>
                <p>This chapter showed how the people around us influence our success. We should choose friends and mentors who challenge us to grow and achieve more.</p>
                <p><strong> I will join study groups with motivated classmates and seek out mentors in the computer science field.</strong></p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="chapter-summary">
                <h3>Chapter 7: Be a Life-Long Learner</h3>
                <p>This chapter distinguished between formal education and self-education. True success comes from continuous learning beyond the classroom through reading and personal development.</p>
                <p><strong>I will read one educational book per month and practice coding outside of class assignments.</strong></p>
